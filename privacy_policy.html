            To maintain your right to privacy while shopping with us 
            is one of our biggest priorities. We, thus, only ask for 
            the most necessary information that is required for us to 
            complete your order or to contact you regarding its status. 
            The information we collect includes your name, email address, 
            shipping address and billing address. Apart from the RAV DOWNLOAD 
            team, this information is only shared with our associated courier 
            partner that will be delivering your ordered items. Please be assured 
            that ravdownload.com does not store your credit / debit card or online

            right to update this Privacy Policy at any time. We will send you an intimation 
            of the same on the email address that you have shared with us. This also further 
            states that ravdownload.com only stores information that is uploaded by you during 
            the registration process, along with shared comments, conversations and interactions

            or online bank account information, etc., is stored in our database. These details are 
            directly entered by you into the bank payment gateways, which are secure. We do not 
            handle this sensitive data or store it. As you browse www.ravdownload.com, advertising 
            cookies will be placed on your computer so that we can understand what you are 
            interested in. Our display advertising partner enables us to present you with
